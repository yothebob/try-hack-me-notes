#+TITLE: Metasploit Exploitation

* Introduction

In` this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.


More specifically, the topics we will cover are:

    How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
    How to use the Metasploit database feature.
    How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
    How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
    How msfvenom can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.


Please note that for all questions that require using a wordlist (e.g brute-force attacks), we will be using the wordlist on the AttackBox found at the following path:

/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt 

If you opt to use your own machine, please download the wordlist by clicking the Download Task Files button to the right.

Start the AttackBox and run Metasploit using the msfconsole command to follow along with this room.
