Scan this box: nmap -sV <machines ip>

nmap is an free, open-source and powerful tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. In our example, we are using nmap to scan this machine to identify all services that are running on a particular port. nmap has many capabilities, below is a table summarising some of the functionality it provides.
| nmap flag     | Description                                                                         |
| -sV           | Attempts to determine the version of the services running                           |
| -p <x> or -p- | Port scan for port <x> or scan all ports                                            |
| -Pn           | Disable host discovery and just scan for open ports                                 |
| -A            | Enables OS and version detection, executes in-build scripts for further enumeration |
| -sC           | Scan with the default nmap scripts                                                  |
| -v            | Verbose mode                                                                        |
| -sU           | UDP port scan                                                                       |
| -sS           | TCP SYN port scan                                                                   |


* Location directories using GoBuster



Using a fast directory discovery tool called GoBuster you will locate a directory that you can use to upload a shell to.
Answer the questions below

Lets first start of by scanning the website to find any hidden directories. To do this, we're going to use GoBuster.

GoBuster is a tool used to brute-force URIs (directories and files), DNS subdomains and virtual host names. For this machine, we will focus on using it to brute-force directories.

Download GoBuster here, or if you're on Kali Linux 2020.1+ run sudo apt-get install gobuster

To get started, you will need a wordlist for GoBuster (which will be used to quickly go through the wordlist to identify if there is a public directory available. If you are using Kali Linux you can find many wordlists under /usr/share/wordlists.

Now lets run GoBuster with a wordlist: gobuster dir -u http://<ip>:3333 -w <word list location>

| GoBuster flag     | Description                               |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| -e                | Print the full URLs in your console       |
| -u                | The target URL                            |
| -w                | Path to your wordlist                     |
| -U and -P         | Username and Password for Basic Auth      |
| -p <x>            | Proxy to use for requests                 |
| -c <http cookies> | Specify a cookie for simulating your auth |
