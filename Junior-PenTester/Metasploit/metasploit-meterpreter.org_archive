You should now have a better understanding of how Metasploit can help you identify potential vulnerabilities on target systems and exploit these vulnerabilities.


You have also seen how the database feature can help you with penetration testing engagements where you have multiple potential targets.

This is especially helpful in situations where you can upload a file to the target system or have the ability to download files to the target system. Meterpreter is a powerful tool that offers a lot of easy to use features during the post-exploitation phase
