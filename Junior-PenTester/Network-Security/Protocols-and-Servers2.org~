#+TITLE: Protocols-and-Servers 2

* Intro

  The Protocols and Servers room covered many protocols:

  - Telnet
  - HTTP
  - FTP
  - SMTP
  - POP3
  - IMAP

Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:

  -  Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
  -  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
  -  Password Attack (Authentication Attack)
  -  Vulnerabilities

From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties. Integrity is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination. Finally, availability refers to being able to access the service when we need it. Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.

Knowing that we are protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), an attack aims to cause Disclosure, Alternation, and Destruction (DAD). The figures below reflect this.

These attacks directly affect the security of the system. For instance, network packet capture violates confidentiality and leads to the disclosure of information. A successful password attack can also lead to disclosure. On the other hand, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack breaks the system’s integrity as it can alter the communicated data. We will focus on these three attacks in this room as these attacks are integral to the protocol design and server implementation.

Vulnerabilities are of a broader spectrum, and exploited vulnerabilities have different impacts on the target systems. For instance, exploiting a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can affect the system’s availability, while exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability can lead to more severe damages. It is important to note that a vulnerability by itself creates a risk; damage can occur only when the vulnerability is exploited. We don’t cover vulnerabilities in this room as they have their own module, Vulnerability Research.

This room will focus on how a protocol can be upgraded or replaced to protect against disclosure and alteration, i.e. protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. We will be recommending other modules that cover additional topics.

Moreover, we introduce Hydra to find weak passwords.

* Sniffing Attack

 Sniffing attack refers to using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target. When a protocol communicates in cleartext, the data exchanged can be captured by a third party to analyse. A simple network packet capture can reveal information, such as the content of private messages and login credentials, if the data isn't encrypted in transit.

A sniffing attack can be conducted using an Ethernet (802.3) network card, provided that the user has proper permissions (root permissions on Linux and administrator privileges on MS Windows). There are many programs available to capture network packets. We consider the following:

  - Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
  - Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
  - Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.

There are several specialized tools for capturing passwords and even complete messages; however, this can still be achieved by Tcpdump and Wireshark with some added effort.

Consider a user checking his email messages using POP3. First, we are going to use Tcpdump to attempt to capture the username and password. In the terminal output below, we used the command sudo tcpdump port 110 -A. Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

We need sudo as packet captures require root privileges. We wanted to limit the number of captured and displayed packets to those exchanged with the POP3 server. We know that POP3 uses port 110, so we filtered our packets using port 110. Finally, we wanted to display the contents of the captured packets in ASCII format, so we added -A.

In the terminal output above, we have removed the unimportant packets to help you better focus on the ones that matter. In particular, the username and password were each sent in their own packet. The first packet explicitly displays “USER frank”, while the last packet reveals the password “PASS D2xc9CgD”.

We could also use Wireshark to achieve the same results. In the Wireshark window below, we can see that we have entered pop in the filter field. Now that we've filtered just the traffic we're interested in, we can see a username and password were captured.

In brief, any protocol that uses cleartext communication is susceptible to this kind of attack. The only requirement for this attack to succeed is to have access to a system between the two communicating systems. This attack requires attention; the mitigation lies in adding an encryption layer on top of any network protocol. In particular, Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been added to HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and many others. For remote access, Telnet has been replaced by the secure alternative Secure Shell (SSH).

If you would like to learn more about Wireshark, we recommend the Wireshark 101 room.

 What do you need to add to the command sudo tcpdump to capture only Telnet traffic?

* Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attack



A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a victim (A) believes they are communicating with a legitimate destination (B) but is unknowingly communicating with an attacker (E). In the figure below, we have A requesting the transfer of $20 to M; however, E altered this message and replaced the original value with a new one. B received the modified messaged and acted on it.

This attack is relatively simple to carry out if the two parties do not confirm the authenticity and integrity of each message. In some cases, the chosen protocol does not provide secure authentication or integrity checking; moreover, some protocols have inherent insecurities that make them susceptible to this kind of attack.

Any time you browse over HTTP, you are susceptible to a MITM attack, and the scary thing is that you cannot recognize it. Many tools would aid you in carrying out such an attack, such as [[https://www.ettercap-project.org/][Ettercap]] and [[https://www.bettercap.org/][Bettercap]].

MITM can also affect other cleartext protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and POP3. Mitigation against this attack requires the use of cryptography. The solution lies in proper authentication along with encryption or signing of the exchanged messages. With the help of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and trusted root certificates, Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects from MITM attacks.

* Transport Layer Security (TLS)

In this task, we learn about a standard solution to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged packets. The following approach can protect against password sniffing and MITM attacks.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) started when the world wide web started to see new applications, such as online shopping and sending payment information. Netscape introduced SSL in 1994, with SSL 3.0 being released in 1996. But eventually, more security was needed, and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol was introduced in 1999. Before we explain what TLS and SSL provide, let’s see how they fit the networking model.

The common protocols we have covered so far send the data in cleartext; this makes it possible for anyone with access to the network to capture, save and analyze the exchanged messages. The image below shows the ISO/OSI network layers. The protocols we have covered so far in this room are on the application layer. Consider the ISO/OSI model; we can add encryption to our protocols via the presentation layer. Consequently, data will be presented in an encrypted format (ciphertext) instead of its original form.

| 7 | Application Layer  | HTTP,FTP,SMTP,POP3,IMAP |
| 6 | Presentation layer | SSL,TLS                 |
| 5 | Session Layer      |                         |
| 4 | Transport Layer    | TCP,UDP                 |
| 3 | Network Layer      | IPv4, IPv6              |
| 2 | Data Link Layer    |                         |
| 1 | Physical Layer     |                         |


Because of the close relation between SSL and TLS, one might be used instead of the other. However, TLS is more secure than SSL, and it has practically replaced SSL. We could have dropped SSL and just written TLS instead of SSL/TLS, but we will continue to mention the two to avoid any ambiguity because the term SSL is still in wide use. However, we can expect all modern servers to be using TLS.

An existing cleartext protocol can be upgraded to use encryption via SSL/TLS. We can use TLS to upgrade HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP, to name a few. The following table lists the protocols we have covered and their default ports before and after the encryption upgrade via SSL/TLS. The list is not exhaustive; however, the purpose is to help us better understand the process.


| Protocol | Default Port | Secured Protocol | Default Port with TLS |
|----------+--------------+------------------+-----------------------|
| HTTP     |           80 | HTTPS            |                   443 |
| FTP      |           21 | FTPS             |                   990 |
| SMTP     |           25 | SMTPS            |                   465 |
| POP3     |          110 | POP3S            |                   995 |
| IMAP     |          143 | IMAPS            |                   993 |


Considering the case of HTTP. Initially, to retrieve a web page over HTTP, the web browser would need at least perform the following two steps:

   - Establish a TCP connection with the remote web server
   - Send HTTP requests to the web server, such as GET and POST requests.

HTTPS requires an additional step to encrypt the traffic. The new step takes place after establishing a TCP connection and before sending HTTP requests. This extra step can be inferred from the ISO/OSI model in the image presented earlier. Consequently, HTTPS requires at least the following three steps:

  -  Establish a TCP connection
  -  Establish SSL/TLS connection
  -  Send HTTP requests to the webserver

To establish an SSL/TLS connection, the client needs to perform the proper handshake with the server. Based on RFC 6101, the SSL connection establishment will look like the figure below.

After establishing a TCP connection with the server, the client establishes an SSL/TLS connection, as shown in the figure above. The terms might look complicated depending on your knowledge of cryptography, but we can simplify the four steps as:

  -  The client sends a ClientHello to the server to indicate its capabilities, such as supported algorithms.
  -  The server responds with a ServerHello, indicating the selected connection parameters. The server provides its certificate if server authentication is required. The certificate is a digital file to identify itself; it is usually digitally signed by a third party. Moreover, it might send additional information necessary to generate the master key, in its ServerKeyExchange message, before sending the ServerHelloDone message to indicate that it is done with the negotiation.
  -  The client responds with a ClientKeyExchange, which contains additional information required to generate the master key. Furthermore, it switches to use encryption and informs the server using the ChangeCipherSpec message.
  -  The server switches to use encryption as well and informs the client in the ChangeCipherSpec message.

If this still sounds sophisticated, don’t worry; we only need the gist of it. A client was able to agree on a secret key with a server that has a public certificate. This secret key was securely generated so that a third party monitoring the channel wouldn’t be able to discover it. Further communication between the client and the server will be encrypted using the generated key.

Consequently, once an SSL/TLS handshake has been established, HTTP requests and exchanged data won’t be accessible to anyone watching the communication channel.

As a final note, for SSL/TLS to be effective, especially when browsing the web over HTTPS, we rely on public certificates signed by certificate authorities trusted by our systems. In other words, when we browse to TryHackMe over HTTPS, our browser expects the TryHackMe web server to provide a signed certificate from a trusted certificate authority, as per the example below. This way, our browser ensures that it is communicating with the correct server, and a MITM attack cannot occur.


In the figure above, we can see the following information:

  -  To whom is the certificate issued? That is the name of the company that will use this certificate.
  -  Who issued the certificate? This is the certificate authority that issued this certificate.
  -  Validity period. You don’t want to use a certificate that has expired, for instance.

Luckily, we don’t have to check the certificate manually for every site we visit; our web browser will do it for us. Our web browser will ensure that we are talking with the correct server and ensure that our communication is secure, thanks to the server’s certificate.



DNS can also be secured using TLS. What is the three-letter acronym of the DNS protocol that uses TLS?

A : DOT

* Secure Shell (SSH)

Secure Shell (SSH) was created to provide a secure way for remote system administration. In other words, it lets you securely connect to another system over the network and execute commands on the remote system. Put simply, the “S” in SSH stands for secure, which can be summarized simply as:

  -  You can confirm the identity of the remote server
  -  Exchanged messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient
  -  Both sides can detect any modification in the messages

The above three points are ensured by cryptography. In more technical terms, they are part of confidentiality and integrity, made possible through the proper use of different encryption algorithms.

To use SSH, you need an SSH server and an SSH client. The SSH server listens on port 22 by default. The SSH client can authenticate using:

  -  A username and a password
  -  A private and public key (after the SSH server is configured to recognize the corresponding public key)

On Linux, macOS, and MS Windows builds after 2018, you can connect to an SSH server using the following command ssh username@10.10.77.70. This command will try to connect to the server of IP address 10.10.77.70 with the login name username. If an SSH server is listening on the default port, it will ask you to provide the password for username. Once authenticated, the user will have access to the target server’s terminal. The terminal output below is an example of using SSH to access a Debian Linux server.
Terminal

           
user@TryHackMe$ ssh mark@10.10.77.70
mark@10.10.77.70's password: XBtc49AB

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
Last login: Mon Sep 20 13:53:17 2021
mark@debian8:~$ 

        

In the example above, we issued the command ssh mark@10.10.77.70. Then, once we entered the correct password, we got access to the remote system’s terminal. SSH is very reliable for remote administration because our username and password were sent encrypted; moreover, all commands we execute on the remote system will be sent over an encrypted channel.

Note that if this is the first time we connect to this system, we will need to confirm the fingerprint of the SSH server’s public key to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. As explained earlier, MITM takes place when a malicious party, E, situates itself between A and B, and communicates with A, pretending to be B, and communicates with B pretending to be A, while A and B think that they are communicating directly with each other. In the case of SSH, we don’t usually have a third party to check if the public key is valid, so we need to do this manually. This attack is shown in the image below.

We can use SSH to transfer files using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) based on the SSH protocol. An example of the syntax is as follows: scp mark@10.10.77.70:/home/mark/archive.tar.gz ~. This command will copy a file named archive.tar.gz from the remote system located in the /home/mark directory to ~, i.e., the root of the home directory of the currently logged-in user.

Another example syntax is scp backup.tar.bz2 mark@10.10.77.70:/home/mark/. This command will copy the file backup.tar.bz2 from the local system to the directory /home/mark/ on the remote system.
Terminal

           
user@TryHackMe$ scp document.txt mark@10.10.77.70:/home/mark
mark@10.10.77.70's password: 
document.txt                                        100% 1997KB  70.4MB/s   00:00

        

As a closing note, FTP could be secured using SSL/TLS by using the FTPS protocol which uses port 990. It is worth mentioning that FTP can also be secured using the SSH protocol which is the SFTP protocol. By default this service listens on port 22, just like SSH.


Use SSH to connect to 10.10.77.70 as mark with the password XBtc49AB. Using uname -r, find the Kernel release?

Use SSH to download the file book.txt from the remote system. How many KBs did scp display as download size?
