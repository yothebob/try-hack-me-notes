#+TITLE: Nmap Post Port Scans

* Intro

  This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.

   -  Nmap Live Host Discovery
   -  Nmap Basic Port Scans
   -  Nmap Advanced Port Scans
   -  Nmap Post Port Scans

In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.

| 1 | Enumerate Targets   |
| 2 | Discover Live Hosts |
| 3 | reverse DNS Lookup  |
| 4 | Scan ports          |
| 5 | Dectect Versions    |
| 6 | Dectect OS          |
| 7 | Traceroute          |
| 8 | Scripts             |
| 9 | Write Output        |

In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:

    - Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)
    - Detect the OS based on any signs revealed by the target
    - Run Nmap’s traceroute
    - Run select Nmap scripts
    - Save the scan results in various formats

This room will focus on these steps and how to execute them after the port scan

* Service Detection

  Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service. Join Vulnerabilities 101 to learn more about searching for vulnerable services.

Adding -sV to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with --version-intensity LEVEL where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. -sV --version-light has an intensity of 2, while -sV --version-all has an intensity of 9.

It is important to note that using -sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan -sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen.

The console output below shows a simple Nmap stealth SYN scan with the -sV option. Adding the -sV option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of 22/tcp open ssh, we obtain 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0). Notice that the SSH protocol is guessed as the service because TCP port 22 is open; Nmap didn’t need to connect to port 22 to confirm. However, -sV required connecting to this open port to grab the service banner and any version information it can get, such as nginx 1.6.2. Hence, unlike the service column, the version column is not a guess.

Note that many Nmap options require root privileges. Unless you are running Nmap as root, you need to use sudo as in the example above.

Start the VM. Once it is ready, open the terminal on the AttackBox to answer the following questions.

* OS Detection and TracerRoute
** OS Detection

Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using -O; this is an uppercase O as in OS. In this example, we ran nmap -sS -O 10.10.225.113 on the AttackBox. Nmap detected the OS to be Linux 3.X, and then it guessed further that it was running kernel 3.13.
Pentester Terminal

           
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS -O 10.10.225.113

The system that we scanned and attempted to detect its OS version is running kernel version 3.16. Nmap was able to make a close guess in this case. In another case, we scanned a Fedora Linux system with kernel 5.13.14; however, Nmap detected it as Linux 2.6.X. The good news is that Nmap detected the OS correctly; the not-so-good news is that the kernel version was wrong.

The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

** Traceroute

If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add --traceroute. In the following example, Nmap appended a traceroute to its scan results. Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the traceroute command found on Linux and macOS or tracert found on MS Windows. Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.

In the following example, we executed nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.225.113 on the AttackBox. We can see that there are no routers/hops between the two as they are connected directly.
Pentester Terminal

It is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses. For more information, visit the Active Reconnaissance room.
